  while "target="_blank" opens the link in a new tab, "target="_parent" opens the link in the parent frame, "target="_self" opens the link in the same frame.
  
  <!-- while target="_self" is default by browser and the most common target is target="_blank" which opens the anchor in a new window(which has been redirected to tabs by browser settings usually). The "_parent","_top","_self" are used in frames and frameset and iframes, are left a mystery to those that are not familiar with the days of iframe site building as the trend. -->
  <!-- target="_self" This opens an anchor in the same frame.What is confusing  is that because we generally don't write in iframes anymore (and the frame and frameset tags are obsolete in HTML5),people assume this a same window function. Instead if this anchor was nested in frames this would open in a sandbox mode of sorts , meaning only in that frame. target="_parent"will open in the next level up of a frame if they were nested to inside each other. target="_top" will open in the top level of the frameset.  -->
